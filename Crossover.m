function [y1, y2] = Crossover(x1, x2)
    % Crossover Performs crossover operation on two binary strings.
    %
    % This function applies one of three crossover methods (single-point, double-point,
    % or uniform) to two parent binary strings (x1 and x2) to produce two offspring (y1 and y2).
    % The method of crossover is chosen randomly based on predefined probabilities.
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   x1, x2 - Parent binary strings.
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   y1, y2 - Offspring binary strings resulting from the crossover operation.
    
    % Probabilities for selecting each crossover method
    % pSinglePoint = 0.1; % Probability of single-point crossover
    % pDoublePoint = 0.2; % Probability of double-point crossover
    % pUniform = 1 - pSinglePoint - pDoublePoint; % Probability of uniform crossover
    % 
    % Select the crossover method based on roulette wheel selection
    % METHOD = RouletteWheelSelection([pSinglePoint pDoublePoint pUniform]);
    
    
    % [y1, y2] = SinglePointCrossover(x1, x2);
    % Perform the crossover based on the selected method
    % switch METHOD
    %     case 1
    %         % Single-point crossover
